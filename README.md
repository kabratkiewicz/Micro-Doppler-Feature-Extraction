# Micro-Doppler Feature Extraction in MATLAB  

This repository contains a MATLAB function designed for extracting signal features from micro-Doppler signatures. The implemented algorithm processes time-frequency representations of radar returns to derive meaningful characteristics for target classification and analysis.  

## Features  
- Computes key micro-Doppler descriptors from input spectrograms  
- Supports time-frequency representations obtained from short-time Fourier transform (STFT)  
- Efficient implementation optimized for large datasets  
- Can be adapted for various radar applications, including human activity recognition and drone detection
